## I'm learning Python!

I'm very happy to be learning Python. Sleep deprivation due to panic attacks is impacting my attention span, but I'm getting through it. Jose Portillo is a great teacher. My spirits are buoyed by looking at possibilities for someone who has learned Python.

In this particular repo, I am keeping track of my lessons involving comparison and logical operators.

Thank you for reading.
